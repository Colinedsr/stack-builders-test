## Repository description

Project done with Laravel.

In Local run these two command lines : 
- `npm run dev`
- `php artisan serve`

## Instructions 

Using the language that you feel most proficient in, create a web crawler using scraping techniques to extract the first 30 entries from https://news.ycombinator.com/. You'll only care about the title, the number of the order, the number of comments, and points for each entry.

From there, we want it to be able to perform a couple of filtering operations:

- Filter all previous entries with more than five words in the title ordered by the number of comments first.
- Filter all previous entries with less than or equal to five words in the title ordered by points.

  
We will measure the performance of the provided solution and your ability to test the requested operations in the scenarios described above. In addition, we'd love to see the following in your code for extra points:
- Good object-oriented code, avoiding repetition and favoring a consistent organization. You should stick to the semantics of your chosen language and be as consistent as possible.
- Correct usage of version control tools, with a good commit history and incremental software delivery practices.
- Automated testing with any framework or tool of your choice.
- We value candidates who love clean, well-structured code and who can creatively solve problems.
- A ReadMe is always helpful to guide us through your work.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
